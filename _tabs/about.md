## About Me
Welcome to my blog! I'm Adam, an enterprise network engineer with an genuine passion for networking and infrastructure technology. I also have a keen interest in home brewing beer. With over a decade of experience in the networking industry, I've had the privilege of working on a variety of bleeding edge projects, from designing and implementing resilient network infrastructure in both the data centre and campus, to troubleshooting complex issues.



## Homelab and Homebrew!
Outside of work, I have a homelab and a home brewery - you'll see posts on these. Tips, guides, thoughts and opinions.



## What's the point?
There is a lot of value in shared knowledge, we all have countless examples of this. This is me doing just that - giving some back!

I also hope you find it interesting to read, well at least some of it!
