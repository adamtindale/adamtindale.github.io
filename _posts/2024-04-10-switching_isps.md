# Switching ISPs
Living in a 'new build', well, it was a new build in 2019, not sure how long the new build tag sticks around. Similar to what will happen to Next-Generation Firewalls when we have another generation. After-Next-Gen? :sunglasses:

Anyway, it means I have an FTTP internet connection.

I was with BT from the beginning and most recently on the Full Fibre 910/110Mbps.

As a home worker, the service was perfect honestly, no noticable performance issues in 5 years. The issue I did have though, was mid-contract price rises. CPI +3.9%.

The 40 year high inflation through 2022/2023 meant a significant increase in price. A victim of the cheap money era really.

Once bitten, twice shy.

In March 2024, I decided to switch ISP to a provider that guarantees the price throughout the term of the contract.

Enter, Zen Internet, Full Fibre 500.

Having friends who have worked there and all speak highly of it - the choice was simple.

The switch process was seamless and it's so far so good - enjoying the Â£30 per month saving too.
