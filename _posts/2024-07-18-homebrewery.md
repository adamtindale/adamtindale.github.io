After years of home brewing on my kitchen hob, I've set up a dedicated home brewery in the garage!

## What are you looking at?
- KegLand BrewZilla Gen4 35L
- KegLand FermZilla Gen3.2 Tri-Conical with ultimate pressure kit, BlowTie Spunding valve v1
- KegLand 60cm Thermowell
- Brewolution Ferminator Basic with 2 expansion modules

- SodaStream bottle/adaptor

Out of shot:

So, as you can see I'm quite a fan of KegLand! An understatement really. Their approach to product development and innovation is first class. 

I'll share my first batch brew day in the next post!
